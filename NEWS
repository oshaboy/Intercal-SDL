	This is the short-form history of the project,
	used mainly for generating release announcements  
	via shipper. For the long form, see the file HISTORY.

* 0.30: 2015=04-02
  Mostly minor build and test fixes.  This release was actually forced by the
  impending doom of gitorious.org; the project hosting had to change and the
  metadata with it.

* 0.29: 2010-11-28
  The first merged release from ESR and Alex Smith, with encouragement from
  Donald Knuth. The compiler now has a regression-test suite. More error
  checks (E990 and E004) have been added. A new program, guess.i, writhes 
  in the pit. The mystery and history of the "Atari implementation" has
  been clarified. Various minor bugs have been fixed.
