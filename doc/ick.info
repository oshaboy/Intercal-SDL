This is ick.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from ick.txi.

This manual is for C-INTERCAL version 0.29.  It does not replace the old
groff manual, nor is it designed to be read in conjunction with it;
instead, it serves a different purpose, of providing information useful
to users of C-INTERCAL (unlike the other manual, it is not derived from
the original INTERCAL-72 manual).
